Me, AfterAStorm, would not be creating this masterpiece if it weren't for the great people over at the [Mech Engineers discord](https://discord.gg/xYA3NPAhqf).

If you want to meet more like-minded mech builders, it's worth a visit!

## Contributions

**All contributions are welcome!**

> Beware: While still in the BETA stage, I, AfterAStorm, will NOT be using seperate branches until full release.

A lot of C# norms when it comes to classes or naming are ignored because it's a space engineers script, not a NASA ship controller

Comments are always useful, especially for the folks trying to learn!
