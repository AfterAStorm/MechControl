> Beware: While still in the BETA stage, I, AfterAStorm, will NOT be using seperate branches until full release.

A lot of C# norms when it comes to classes or naming are ignored because it's a space engineers script, not a NASA ship controller

Comments are always useful, especially for the folks trying to learn!
